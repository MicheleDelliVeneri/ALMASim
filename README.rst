.. INTRO_START_LABEL

ALMASim is a package to generate mock observations of HI line galaxies as observed by the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA). ALMASim primary goal is to allow users to generate simulated datasets on which to test deconvolution and source detection models. ALMASim is intended to leverage MPI parallel computing on modern HPC clusters to generate thousands of ALMA data cubes. Users are free to set both source and observational parameters such as antenna configuration, bandwidth, integration time and so on, or completely generate data using random configuration and sources.
ALMASim is built upon the CASA PiP Wheels (https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), the MARTINI Package (https://github.com/kyleaoman/martini), and the Illustris Python Package (https://github.com/illustristng/illustris_python) to be able to generate observations of both high redshift point-like sources and close extendend sources in all possible ALMA configurations. 
For every observed target ALMASim generates:
- A Sky model .fits cube containing the source without any source of noise or instrumental effects;
- A Dirty .fits cube, i.e. the Fourier inversion of the observed visibilities 
- A Measurements set .npy file containing the measured visibilities as a numpy array 
- A parameters.csv containing the observational and source parameters

Installation Notes
==================
.. INSTALLATION_NOTES_START_LABEL

ALMASim works with ``python3`` (version ``3.8``), and does not support ``python2``.

Stable releases are available via PyPI_ (``pip install ALMASim``) or GitHub .
The github main branch is actively developed: things will change, bugs will happen. Any feedback is greatly appreciated via github or micheledelliveneri@gmail.com.

Getting started
===============

.. QUICKSTART_START_LABEL

To run the simulation, just navigate to the ALMASim folder and execute 
``python main.py --option value --option1 value1 value2``
to check the available option run 
``python main.py -h``
If you are interested in simulating Extended sources, you need to download and configure the Illustris TNG100-1 simulation folder.
TNGStructure.PNG shows an example for Snapshot-99, reproduce this for every Snapshot you are interested i. You can check more at the Illustris TNG official website: https://www.tng-project.org/data/
