"""Read ALMA QA0 reports.

Every execution block ships a ``<eb_uid>.qa0_report.pdf`` in its member OUS
``qa/`` directory. Its ``QA0 Status`` field decides whether ALMA delivers
calibration for that EB at all: ``Pass`` blocks always carry calibration
products, ``SemiPass`` blocks never do. ALMA still ships the raw ASDM for a
SemiPass block, so resolving and downloading without consulting this field
pulls execution blocks that can never be calibrated.

Do not use ``ExecBlock Status`` for this decision -- it is a separate field and
does not discriminate: a SemiPass block frequently carries
``ExecBlock Status = SUCCESS``.
