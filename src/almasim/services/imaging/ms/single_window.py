    One attempt; ``extract_single_window_ms_subprocess`` retries lock-file

    Rows whose WEIGHT exceeds ``max_weight`` are left out (see
    ``DEFAULT_MAX_WEIGHT``; ``None`` or 0 keeps every row); the result
    reports how many were dropped.

    WSClean 3.7 reads out of bounds in its reordering step when an MS holds
    several spectral windows and ``-spws`` selects one (an ALMA split MS
    lists 60 windows, 4 of them populated); the crash is heap-layout
    dependent, so about half the tasks die. Handing WSClean an MS with a
    single spectral window lets it use its contiguous reader (``-no-reorder``)
    and skip that code entirely. The copy is a deep copy of the selected rows
    with all subtables; DATA_DESCRIPTION and SPECTRAL_WINDOW are collapsed to
    the one window (renumbered 0) so WSClean sees exactly one band.
